  <section class="intro">
    <p>Gradually venturing into the IT world, I embarked on my journey four years ago as a Web Analyst at a digital
      advertising agency. It was during this time that I had my first exposure to Python and SQL, unraveling the power
      of data engineering.
      <br><br>This experience sparked my passion for technology and during the COVID-19 quarantine with some free time
      at my disposal, I passionately delved into the captivating world of frontend development. Since then, I have been
      actively expanding my knowledge and skills, pursuing the Frontend Engineer course on Codecademy and creating
      personal pet projects. You can explore some of these projects below.
